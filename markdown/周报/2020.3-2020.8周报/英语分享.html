<p>老师同学们大家好，我是来自微纳电子系的莫海，今天给大家介绍的是芯片的生产过程与中国集成电路的发展现状。</p>
<p>中国芯片消耗大国，长期以来严重以来芯片进口，2018年中国进口石油4.62亿吨，总额近1.59万亿元，同一年，中国进口芯片2.184万亿元，大约是全年军费开支的两倍。</p>
<p>为何芯片研究这么难？其中有历史的原因也有技术的原因，我简略的介绍一下四点</p>
<ol>
<li>在过去的几十年中，中国经济比较落后，需要大力发展基础产业，而在那时刚好是集成电路发展的黄金时期，Intel的8080开始开始面世，配套的操作系统等软件开始飞速的发展，而今已经进入到了寡头竞争的阶段，排名第一的企业占据50%以上的市场，排名前十的企业占据90%的市场，小企业没有生存的空间</li>
<li>以美国为首的西方国家统一战线，禁止企业向中国出售先进的芯片技术，导致中国技术积累缓慢，投资巨大但是收获很小。</li>
<li>芯片技术需要一定时间的积累，且投资巨大，风险很高，想分从市场上夺取已经分配好的蛋糕十分的困难。</li>
<li>生产芯片不仅仅需要硬件上过关，还需要软件上协同，比如配套的操作系统以及软件等</li>
</ol>
<p>为了更好的了解芯片，接下来我给大家简单的介绍一下芯片的生产过程</p>
<p>step 1, The process of creating a computer chip begins with a type of sand called silica sand（硅沙）,  which is comprised of silicon dioxide(二氧化硅). Silicon is the base material for semiconductor manufacturing(半导体制造) and must be pure before it can be used in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>step 2, Multiple purification and filtering processes are performed in order to deliver electronic-grade silicon, which has a purity of 99.9999%. A purified silicon ingot, which weighs around 100kg, is shaped from melted silica and made ready for the next step.</p>
<p>step 3. The circular silicon ingot is sliced into wafers as thin as possible, And then refined and polished in order to provide the best possible surface for the following steps.</p>
<p>step 4. After being polished and readied for the process, a layer of photoresist is spread thinly across the wafer. This layer is then exposed to a UV light mask(紫外光), which is shaped in the pattern of the microprocessor’s circuits.</p>
<p>step 5. Exposed photoresist is washed off and the silicon wafer is bombarded with ions in order to alter its conductive properties – this is called doping. The remaining photoresist is then washed off, revealing a pattern of affected and unaffected material.</p>
<p>step 6. Chemicals are then used to remove unwanted silicon, leaving behind thin silicon ridges.（硅脊）</p>
<p>step 7. manufacturers use a process called electroplating（电镀） to deposit copper ions（沉积铜离子） on the surface of the transistor（晶体管）, forming a layer of copper on top of the insulation.</p>
<p>step 8. All the transistors are now connected in an architecture which allows the chip to function like a processor.</p>
<p>step9. The chips on the wafer are now ready to be tested</p>
<p>由于近几年物联网以及AI的发展，很多全新的领域被提出，比如AI芯片。中国这次抓住了历史的机遇，很多优秀的AI芯片公司在蓬勃的发展，也有生产出了很多世界领先的产品，比如华为的麒麟芯片，寒武纪的思元芯片以及阿里的含光芯片等。中国芯片领域正在欣欣向荣，我相信不久的将来将会跻身世界前列。</p>

<p>Good morning teachers and classmates. I am Mo Hai from the Department of Micro-Nano Electronics. Today I will introduce the production process of chips and the development status in China.</p>
<p>China is a big chip consuming country and has been importing chips for a long time. In 2018, China imported 462 million tons of oil, with a total value of nearly 1.6 trillion yuan. In the same year, China imported 2.2 trillion yuan in chips, which is about twice the annual military expenditure.</p>
<p>Why is chip research so difficult? There are historical reasons and technical reasons, I will briefly introduce four points</p>
<ol>
<li>In the past few decades, China ’s economy is relatively backward, and it is necessary to develop basic industries. At that time, it was a golden period for the development of integrated circuits. Intel 8080 began to appear, and the supporting operating system and other software began to develop rapidly. Now it has entered the stage of oligarchic competition（寡头竞争）. The first-ranked enterprises occupy more than 50% of the market, and the top-ten enterprises occupy 90% of the market. Small businesses have no room for survival.</li>
<li>The united front of the United States and other Western countries prohibits companies from selling advanced chip technology to China, resulting in slow accumulation of technology and huge investment but little gain.</li>
<li>Chip technology requires accumulation, huge investment, and high risks. It is very difficult to seize the already distributed cake from the market.</li>
<li>The production of chips requires not only hardware clearance, but also software collaboration, such as supporting operating systems and software.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to better understand the chip, let me briefly introduce the production process of the chip</p>
<p>step 1, The process of creating a computer chip begins with a type of sand called silica sand（硅沙）,  which is comprised of silicon dioxide(二氧化硅). Silicon is the base material for semiconductor manufacturing(半导体制造) and must be pure before it can be used in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>step 2, Multiple purification and filtering processes are performed in order to deliver electronic-grade silicon, which has a purity of 99.9999%. A purified silicon ingot, which weighs around 100kg, is shaped from melted silica and made ready for the next step.</p>
<p>step 3. The circular silicon ingot is sliced into wafers as thin as possible, And then refined and polished in order to provide the best possible surface for the following steps.</p>
<p>step 4. After being polished and readied for the process, a layer of photoresist is spread thinly across the wafer. This layer is then exposed to a UV light mask(紫外光), which is shaped in the pattern of the microprocessor’s circuits.</p>
<p>step 5. Exposed photoresist is washed off and the silicon wafer is bombarded with ions in order to alter its conductive properties – this is called doping. The remaining photoresist is then washed off, revealing a pattern of affected and unaffected material.</p>
<p>step 6. Chemicals are then used to remove unwanted silicon, leaving behind thin silicon ridges.（硅脊）</p>
<p>step 7. manufacturers use a process called electroplating（电镀） to deposit copper ions（沉积铜离子） on the surface of the transistor（晶体管）, forming a layer of copper on top of the insulation.</p>
<p>step 8. All the transistors are now connected in an architecture which allows the chip to function like a processor.</p>
<p>step9. The chips on the wafer are now ready to be tested</p>
<p>if you not quite clear, let’s watch a video </p>
<p>Due to the development of the Internet of Things and AI in recent years, many new fields have been proposed, such as AI chips. China has seized the historical opportunity this time, many excellent AI chip companies are booming, and they have produced many world-leading products, such as Huawei’s Kirin chip, Cambrian Siyuan chip, and Ali’s Hanguang chip and so on. I believe that China’s chip industry will rank among the forefront of the world in the near future.</p>
